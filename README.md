### The Matching Results using the Sum-of-Squared-Distance
bikes1 and bikes2  
![ssd matching bikes1 and bikes2](results/bikes1_bikes2_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

bikes1 and bikes3  
![ssd matching bikes1 and bikes3](results/bikes1_bikes3_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

graf1 and graf2  
![ssd matching graf1 and graf2](results/graf1_graf2_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

graf1 and graf3  
![ssd matching graf1 and graf3](results/graf1_graf3_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the big rotation which change the appearance.

leuven1 and leuven2  
![ssd matching leuven1 and leuven2](results/leuven1_leuven2_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the big lighting difference between the two images.

leuven1 and leuven3  
![ssd matching leuven1 and leuven3](results/leuven1_leuven3_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the big lighting difference between the two images.

wall1 and wall2  
![ssd matching wall1 and wall2](results/wall1_wall2_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the fact that the walls have repeating patterns and everywhere looks similar.

wall1 and wall3  
![ssd matching wall1 and wall3](results/wall1_wall3_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the fact that the walls have repeating patterns and everywhere looks similar.

### The Matching Results using the Simple-SIFT
bikes1 and bikes2  
![ssift matching bikes1 and bikes2](results/bikes1_bikes2_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

bikes1 and bikes3  
![ssift matching bikes1 and bikes3](results/bikes1_bikes3_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

graf1 and graf2  
![ssift matching graf1 and graf2](results/graf1_graf2_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

graf1 and graf3  
![ssift matching graf1 and graf3](results/graf1_graf3_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the big rotation which change the appearance.

leuven1 and leuven2  
![ssift matching leuven1 and leuven2](results/leuven1_leuven2_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

leuven1 and leuven3  
![ssift matching leuven1 and leuven3](results/leuven1_leuven3_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images look very good.

wall1 and wall2  
![ssift matching wall1 and wall2](results/wall1_wall2_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are sparse but accurate.

wall1 and wall3  
![ssift matching wall1 and wall3](results/wall1_wall3_ssift_matches.png)
The matchings between the two images are not very ideal.
This is probably due to the big rotation that changes the distributions of the gradients.

### RANSAC and Stitching using Affine and SSIFT
bikes1 and bikes2  
![ransac bikes1 and bikes2](results/bikes2_ssift_affine_ransac_with_bikes1.png)
![stitch bikes1 and bikes2](results/bikes2_ssift_affine_stitch_with_bikes1.png)
Using SSIFT produces similar but a little bit worse result.
This is probably due to that the second image is blurred thus has less clear gradients.

bikes1 and bikes3  
![ransac bikes1 and bikes3](results/bikes3_ssift_affine_ransac_with_bikes1.png)
![stitch bikes1 and bikes3](results/bikes3_ssift_affine_stitch_with_bikes1.png)
Using SSIFT produces similar but a little bit worse result.
This is probably due to that the third image is blurred thus has less clear gradients.

graf1 and graf2  
![ransac graf1 and graf2](results/graf2_ssift_affine_ransac_with_graf1.png)
![stitch graf1 and graf2](results/graf2_ssift_affine_stitch_with_graf1.png)
Using SSIFT produces similar result.

graf1 and graf3  
![ransac graf1 and graf3](results/graf3_ssift_affine_ransac_with_graf1.png)
![stitch graf1 and graf3](results/graf3_ssift_affine_stitch_with_graf1.png)
Using SSIFT cannot produce good result, either.

leuven1 and leuven2  
![ransac leuven1 and leuven2](results/leuven2_ssift_affine_ransac_with_leuven1.png)
![stitch leuven1 and leuven2](results/leuven2_ssift_affine_stitch_with_leuven1.png)
Using SSIFT produces result that is much better than using SSD.
This is because the lighting changes do not change the distribution of gradients too much.

leuven1 and leuven3  
![ransac leuven1 and leuven3](results/leuven3_ssift_affine_ransac_with_leuven1.png)
![stitch leuven1 and leuven3](results/leuven3_ssift_affine_stitch_with_leuven1.png)
Using SSIFT produces result that is much better than using SSD.
This is because the lighting changes do not change the distribution of gradients too much.

wall1 and wall2  
![ransac wall1 and wall2](results/wall2_ssift_affine_ransac_with_wall1.png)
![stitch wall1 and wall2](results/wall2_ssift_affine_stitch_with_wall1.png)
Using SSIFT produces result that is much better than using SSD.
But I think this is due to the mechanism we use to determine the matchings between two points.

wall1 and wall3  
![ransac wall1 and wall3](results/wall3_ssift_affine_ransac_with_wall1.png)
![stitch wall1 and wall3](results/wall3_ssift_affine_stitch_with_wall1.png)
